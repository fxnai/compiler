# Function currently does not support lambda expressions.
# We can trace through lambdas, and even lower calls to lambdas. The challenge is in treating them as objects.
# In Python, you can pass around a lambda, add it to a list, add arbitrary attributes, and so on.
# In native code, we can only make a lambda concrete by attaching types to it. But what types do we use?
# Hence for now, we don't support lambdas--not even partially.
